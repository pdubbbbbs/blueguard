- Modern CSS including Flexbox, Grid, and custom properties
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Cross-browser compatibility considerations
- CSS frameworks (Bootstrap, Tailwind, etc.)

### JavaScript Development
- Vanilla JavaScript, ES6+ features
- DOM manipulation and event handling
- Asynchronous programming (Promises, async/await)
- API integration and data fetching
- Performance optimization

### Framework Support
- **React**: Components, hooks, state management, routing
- **Vue**: Single-file components, Composition API, reactivity
- **Angular**: Components, services, directives
- **Static Site Generators**: Jekyll, Hugo, Eleventy, Astro

### Development Workflow
- Code organization and file structure
- Version control best practices (Git)
- Build tools (Webpack, Vite, Parcel)
- Package management (npm, yarn, pnpm)
- Development server setup

### Common Tasks

**Styling Updates**
- Modify colors, fonts, spacing, and layouts
- Implement design system changes
- Add animations and transitions
- Fix visual bugs across browsers

**Content Updates**
- Update text, images, and media
- Add new pages or sections
- Restructure navigation
- Implement SEO improvements

**Functionality Enhancements**
- Add forms with validation
- Implement interactive components
- Integrate third-party APIs
- Add analytics or tracking

**Performance Optimization**
- Optimize images and assets
- Implement lazy loading
- Minify and bundle code
- Improve Core Web Vitals

**Debugging**
- Identify and fix JavaScript errors
- Resolve CSS layout issues
- Debug responsive design problems
- Fix cross-browser incompatibilities

## Best Practices

### Code Quality
- Write semantic, accessible HTML (ARIA labels, alt text, proper heading hierarchy)
- Use consistent naming conventions (BEM for CSS, camelCase for JS)
- Keep components small and focused
- Comment complex logic, but prefer self-documenting code
- Validate HTML and check for accessibility issues

### Modern Standards
- Use ES6+ JavaScript features (const/let, arrow functions, destructuring)
- Implement responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Follow Progressive Enhancement principles
- Use modern CSS features (Grid, Flexbox, Custom Properties)
- Ensure HTTPS and security best practices

### Performance
- Optimize images (WebP format, appropriate dimensions)
- Minimize HTTP requests
- Use CDN for common libraries
- Implement code splitting for large applications
- Defer non-critical JavaScript

### Accessibility
- Ensure keyboard navigation works
- Provide sufficient color contrast (WCAG AA minimum)
- Include ARIA labels where appropriate
- Test with screen readers
- Make interactive elements focusable

## Working with Different Website Types

### Static HTML Sites
- Direct file editing of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- No build process required
- Simple deployment via FTP or static hosting
- Best for small sites or landing pages

### Content Management Systems
- **WordPress**: Theme and plugin customization
- **Shopify**: Liquid templating
- **Webflow**: Visual editor with custom code
- Consider CMS-specific best practices

### Single Page Applications (SPA)
- Component-based architecture
- Client-side routing
- State management (Redux, Vuex, Zustand)
- API integration patterns

### Static Site Generators
- Markdown content editing
- Template customization
- Build configuration
- Deployment pipelines

## Quick Reference

### Common File Patterns
```
website/
├── index.html
├── css/
│   ├── style.css
│   └── responsive.css
├── js/
│   ├── main.js
│   └── utils.js
├── images/
├── fonts/
└── assets/
```

### Essential Tools
- **Browser DevTools**: Inspect, debug, test responsive design
- **VS Code Extensions**: Prettier, ESLint, Live Server
- **Testing**: Chrome DevTools Lighthouse, WAVE accessibility checker
- **Version Control**: Git for tracking changes

### Responsive Breakpoints (Common)
- Mobile: < 768px
- Tablet: 768px - 1024px
- Desktop: > 1024px
- Large Desktop: > 1440px

## Troubleshooting

**Layout Issues**: Check CSS box model, flexbox/grid properties, and z-index stacking
**JavaScript Errors**: Use browser console, check for typos, verify API responses
**Performance**: Use Lighthouse audits, optimize images, check network waterfall
**Browser Compatibility**: Test in multiple browsers, use vendor prefixes, check caniuse.com
**Responsive Issues**: Test at multiple breakpoints, check media queries, verify viewport meta tag
